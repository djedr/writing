# Jevko for learning, creating, and research

Writing this out to see how it looks like as a "writing exercise".

At this point it's pretty clear that my old simulations, imaginings of what Jevko could be are very unlikely to manifest in reality. If there is no significant natural interest coming from anywhere and I am unable to make it happen because of whatever then in all probability it's not happening.

What I am making happening by writing this though is taking a fork in the road. I'm gonna try to do something else. NB maybe the trickstery powers of procrastination will actually make me push the thing forward in the end. :D

Anyway I think I will be changing the presentation, the "target audience" for Jevko to those who actually have shown interest in it in reality. So I'm making an adjustment to reality.

And the people who found Jevko interesting and useful were tinkerers, hackers, learners, minimalists. I guess people kinda like me. Maybe I can am only able to create or otherwise manifest what I am, in a way. Anyway, I drift, I digress.

Also, my self-imposed time limit is ticking out, so I'll cut this short. Point is: I'm thinking about refocusing Jevko on things like programming or other computer language development, to present it as a tool for those who want to learn that and prototype in that area; for those who are looking for a minimal universal notation for their own personal use; for those who'd like to research the foundations of syntax, etc. No more trying to present it as a realistic alternative to JSON, XML, HTML, INI, etc. established formats and syntaxes.

I shall put reality instead of vision at the forefront of this undertaking.

Time's up. Here I have to cut.
