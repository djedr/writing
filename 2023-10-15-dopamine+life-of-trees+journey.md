# dopamine

supposedly dopamine is responsible for a very broad range of human behaviors and disorders. it is THE motivation chemical, neurotransmitter. because of changes in dopamine we feel compelled to-- or should I say, our being compelled to pursue our goals is directly correlated with changes in dopamine. it's connected to both pleasure (when heightened) and frustration (when lowered). when we anticipate a possible reward it goes up in a spike and then falls below baseline, which causes us to pursue the reward. when we get the reward it goes up again in a spike. between anticipation and getting the reward it also is modulated, according to whether we are getting closer or further away and according to whether it seems likely that we are going to get the reward at all.

it is crucially important that we maintain enough dopamine available in our body. to ensure that we should get enough restful sleep, eat properly (in particular foods high in phenylalanine and tyrosine), regularly exercise and expose ourselves to the morning sunshine. we can also employ techniques under the umbrealla of Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) which can significantly boost dopamine.
