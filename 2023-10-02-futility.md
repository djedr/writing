# futility

ultimately it really is down to what's right here, right now. beyond that things don't really exist.

to write down relatively coherent thoughts every day like in the case of this little exercise does prove challenging sometimes. there is some tacit mechanism which admits or rejects what is generated.

I sit down and I try to focus on this, trying to suppress interruptions for a little while. only if this succeeds, the exercise can proceed.

today I've come only this far.
