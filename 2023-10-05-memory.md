# memory

how at some point you realize that you've been pronouncing a word wrong for a long time.

you've just memorized it wrong and kept repeating it without ever looking closely again.

typically you look closely only once, when you first memorize a word, and afterwards you use a different system to recognize the word. a faster but less accurate system.

it's similar with labeling things. you learn a name of a tree or a bird or a device. from then on you look at that thing and you identify it using the label and you stop there. you move on to the next thing.

you look at the world through memories, through your first experiences with things. you look closely very rarely and then you just routinely look at the surface of things, just recalling.

that's a tendency, a function of the mind that it might be good to be aware of. then you can counteract it. then you can correct your errors and deepen your understandings.

then again, if you always go around looking closely at things and slowly breaking them down and trying to deepen your understanding, you may get lost in that, you may never get anywhere. there is a balance to find. a sweet spot, where it works best for you in a given situation.

and then life is changing, circumstances, environment, people around you. and you adjust, adapt to that. your abilities, your flexibility, it's all changing. incredibly, we manage to adapt.
