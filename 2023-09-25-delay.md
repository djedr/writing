# delay

overthunk to bits, today's entry is.

inexplicable workings of the cabeza bring forth a time dilation independent of darkness, unlike apertures under direction of the nerves.

mowing down words with a blade on a rotor, the smell of fresh cut articles.

seconds turn into minutes, minutes turn into "too late, time's up, missed the little square of today".

time used to be visualized on a circle, progression and cyclic nature of things clear. nowadays it's liquid crystals in a void.

wrap your head around that, humanoid.
