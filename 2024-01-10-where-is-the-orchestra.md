# where is the orchestra?

(from the lyrics of "Whereâ€™s the Orchestra?" by Billy Joel, 
as covered by Serj Tankian from System of A Down)

where's the orchestra? . . ... 5  
wasn't this supposed to be a musical? .. . .. . . . ... 11  
here I am, in the balcony . . . . . ... 8  

squeezed into 5-7-5:

where's the orchestra? . . ... 5  
a musical was promised . ... . .. 7  
here I am, upstairs . . . .. 5
