# any word

that comes to mind can start a train of thought. or a piece of writing. you may decide to follow that or not. following it leads to more words, eventually to a fork in the road. then you choose a word from among a few alternatives that leads you into another thread.

how do you generate the words? how do you choose? interesting is the capacity to question, examine that. the capacity to self-reflect. even about such basic or fundamental mechanisms. perhaps inquiring about them alters them in some way. sometimes it seems that answers to these questions are necessarily ever-receding.

still, we continue to chase.

it's very difficult to describe an irregular shape with words. for example the shape of a computer mouse. to describe it in such a way as to transfer the image as accurately as possible to another mind. where it could be precisely reconstructed. that's not quite how things work with written or spoken language.

the kind of information that can be transferred well in words is limited.

interesting how we transfer philosophy, religion, politics in words. and how we seem to purport or at least hope that this is effective in replicating ideas with sensible fidelity.
