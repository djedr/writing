self-reflection, introspection -- these kinds of things are pretty freaky. but very human it seems. at least as far as we know. hard to tell whether other animals introspect and self-reflect, because they don't talk about it much or we can't understand or both.

anyway I have this old Japanese marker. a red (Strong Red) Copic ciao R46. has two ends for inking. one is "medium broad" which is a typical marker-like shape, a rectangular tip cut at an angle. the other end is "super brush" which is brush-like. it's a pretty good marker. after all these years, definitely more than 10, it is still working as new. the color is indeed strong, very vivid juicy red, a bit towards the darker side. it's a good marker -- whoever recommended it back then was right.
