# languages

cultures, religions, nations, ideologies, things like that. it's incredible how they develop. start with a homogenous group of people. split it into smaller groups. isolate them. wait a while. somebody is bound to have some ideas and somebody is bound to like them. ideas spread. ways of living spread. cool tricks. greetings. dances. fashion. medicine. diet: what is available in the local environment is bound to be the most relevant.

and how in today's world it all mixes together. travel faster. bring everything closer together. information travels instantaneously. goods, people travel faster and faster. few travel super-fast on demand. jet airplanes. now even space rockets.

we could quickly move products from place to place on space rockets. very fast shipping. we could also move nuclear warheds. fast annihilation. undo thousands of years of languages, religions, nations, ideologies, things like that. because some hotheads disagree. because there are ideas of "ultimate importance" at stake. because your pile can't be bigger than mine. let's see who is crazier and pushes the button first. you gonna chicken out?

perhaps it's going to be them. chickens. once we conclude our little human experiment and cancel ourselves, chickens are going to take over. i hear chickens are decent people.
