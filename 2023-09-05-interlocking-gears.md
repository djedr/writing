# interlocking gears

maybe there is a simple fix to get the machine running again. but to figure out the fix! that may not be as simple...

most people most their lives indirectly interact with people and machines that they don't know and mostly will never know. houses, furniture, pots and pans, cups and mugs, electronics, clothing, the water you drink and wash your body with, cosmetics, cars and other vehicles, trees planted and raised with human hand; at parks, squares, forests; ponds and lakes;

factories and industrial facilities inhaling and exhaling all day; electricity; gas; coal; money: the blood of the system; people in the streets, ee da de da de da de da;

ambulances, garbage trucks, police cars, cleaning, maintenance, supervision, decoration; fans spinning, wheels turning, fumes churning; bees in a hive; ants in an anthill; laser focus: a writer, a technician, a bricklayer; the big picture and fine details -- all taken care of eventually;

diners, temples, courts, establishments; opening and closing, opening and closing; people flowing through; maternity wards and crematoria; hospitals and funeral homes; officials, politicians, soldiers, various agents, teachers, bureaucrats, lawyers, musicians, artists, performers; schoolchildren, university students, the young and the old, the rich and the poor; introverts and extroverts; scientists; spiritual types;

should we celebrate and respect each other for making all this work?
