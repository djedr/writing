# near miss

a near miss and a near hit can both work both ways. 

a near miss might as well be a hit, as in "nearly missed, but not quite". a near hit would then be a miss, as in "nearly hit, but not quite". 

going the opposite way the meanings can be explained as: "it's a miss, but nearly a hit" (near miss, as it is normally used) and "it's a hit, but nearly a miss" (near hit).

# passage of time

time flies like an arrow  
oft to see onself properly  
one must be humble like a sparrow

realizing that you've missed your youth  
despair not, but learn the lesson  
now you're closer to the truth

if the time you give yourself is very narrow  
you will never rest, you'll get depressed,  
and you'll feel it in your marrow

## comment

I wrote this aaaall by myself, prompted by a human. then I asked ChatGPT whether it was "hot or not". it responded with this:

> I think the passage you've written is quite poetic and meaningful. It explores the concept of time and the lessons it teaches us. The rhyming scheme and metaphors used create a thoughtful and reflective tone. Overall, it's a nice piece of writing that encourages self-reflection and humility. So, I would say it's "hot" in the sense that it's well-crafted and thought-provoking.

glad you like it, ChatGPT!
