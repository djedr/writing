# writing without editing

sentences grow in natural patterns, like clouds, trees, grass; reading raw unfiltered, unedited writing feels like looking at patterns in wood or something; and we realize more this way that we project a lot of meaning, pick up a lot of patterns that aren't necessarily "there"; when we're reading unedited writing; we do the editing for the writer;

in the end nothing is really "there"; just some markings on paper or pixels on a screen; made to suggest certain meanings; with trust that they will communicate some desired information; assuming some shared understanding of common patterns; in 10000 years a piece of writing from today might be a real puzzler;

100 people read the same piece of writing, forming 100 slightly different simulacra in their minds; these patterns then intermix with other patterns, are distorted, refined, etceteraed; the changed patterns are then imperfectly propagated further; and this organism of information and ideas, itself a weird outgrowth of the biological and then physical world (probably a sound-sounding argument could be made for information being the base realtiy, especially compelling for people who live completely immersed in the world of information, insulated and disconnected from the biological and the physical; it may all be circular in some weird way too; confusion and paradox become familiar companions at this level of inquiry);

once there was ether; or rather ethers; or rather aethers; like the luminiferous aether; today it isn't "there" anymore; but it is still in another "there"; it has moved from one "there" to another; like so many ideas; some of them we hold onto dearly;
