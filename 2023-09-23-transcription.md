# transcription

what is the difference between the mechanical process of transcription and the creative process of original writing?

if they were the same kind of process in reality, then what? original writing would then be transcription from...? from where?

we can imagine an infinite library of all possible writing. when you sit down to write something, you enter that library, pick up a volume, open it on a page, and start transcribing. it could be an audio library all the same. no matter. point is: it is already created, you just pull it into the material world.

I guess this is an idea somewhat similar to Platonic idealism.
