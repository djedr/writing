# things which have never been seen before

tomorrow's newspaper. the exact patterns in the clouds at any given time. the exact structure and patterns of any complex thing. like a tree with all its branches and leaves. like blood vessels in a body. like a face.

there are so many similar, but unique things. variations on a theme. on one hand we know the theme -- it has been seen before. on the other hand this specific instance is unique -- it has never been seen before.

continuous unbroken global rise in prosperity for a few years. zero wars or conflicts for a few years. universal peace and satisfaction. a true utopia. never been seen before.

definitive proof of existence of extraterrestrial life. a fleet of alien spaceships. a cosmic megastructure. a stream of electromagnetic waves from a non-human civilization. never been seen before.

this piece of writing. the exact words in the exact order. never been seen before.

you reading it. you thinking about it. you simultaneously experiencing the world around you as it is in this specific moment. no specific moment has been seen before.

or so I reasonably presume.
