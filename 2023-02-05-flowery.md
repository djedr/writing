Expectation of exceptions is a reasonable little artifact of the mind to have.

Always these come, inevitably, without exception -- that's an exception to the rule of always-expecting-exceptions.

These sorts of paradoxes tend to arise when one formulates generic rules like the one just described. This probably has something to do with Russell's paradox. The one about sets.

Perhaps that's telling us something fundamental about reality and dismissing that as an error and working around is not the only valid course of action. Not the only productive way to do it. Or not. Anyway, certainly one can generate a whole lot of sensibly-sounding sentences this way.
