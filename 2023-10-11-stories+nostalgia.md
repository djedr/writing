# stories

we make them up all the time. stories about life, individual, collective, in general. how life started. how it evolved. how our own lives progressed and what it means. cast a narration onto a few data points. poof, a story.

make up the rest of the story, autocomplete. if it went like this, it may continue like that. make up the future. predict it. try to make it happen. prophesize. force these prophecies into reality. make it all more and more elaborate.

stories are ideas, memes. memes are spread, confronted. we carry them and they depend on us to realize themselves.

# nostalgia

longing for what came before  
warm memories collected  
preserved in lore  
resurrected

look out an autumn window  
stop for a second  
see what is reckoned  
here in this verse:

ah, what I would give  
to be there and then again
