# Out of ideas

How can one be out of ideas? How did they were in possession of any in the first place?

Ideas are made of thoughts. Thoughts are made of something-or-other. Anyway, you stop divvying it up at some level, in order to stay sane and make progress. Gotta atomize.

Now, where do thoughts come from? Can one be out of those? So long as one is alive, not really.

These are generated by a special sort of Non-Artificial All-Natural General Intelligence concentrated somewhere in one's cabeza. This thing is incredible: it can do all kinds of things in completely different domains, powered by a handful of organic trash per a small amount of time. Kinda like DeLorean in Back To The Future, except really. This thing doesn't consume a lot of power -- it's highly efficient, highly fault-tolerant, adaptable. How is it put together? That's a trillion-dollar question. No, trillion dollars is an underestimate. It's beyond estimating.

The only way to replicate the functionality exactly is to literally replicate. Use the built-in mechanism. All other ways are mimicry and will never get it all perfectly right.

Best we can practically do is augmentation. But that will always have limits.

Alright, we're out of time (that we can be so long as we arbitrarily apportion the infinite resource -- infinite on the transcendental level). So what was the point of this writing exercise? What's the point of any exercise, really? Any ideas?
