# sleep, disrupted

sleep is a vital functionactivity which if disrupted sufficiently will produce aberrations in the body and mind of the sleep-deprived.

modern life offers countless ways to disrupt sleep; the value placed on sleep in contemporary society is quite disproportional to its significance; we've set up many devices and customs that effectively disrupt sleep very efficiently; little sleep is even venerated as the mark of the hard-working person;

we deprioritize and give up sleep, even if in consequence we lose health or even lives; we live on stimulants, hopelessly addicted; detached from natural patterns of the Sun; we are increasingly jittery, chaotic; putting up with increasing amounts of noise, interruption;

on top of that we are addicted to information; hopelessly trapped in hyperoptimized loops, cycles of news and social media; meanwhile actual social interactions, personal relationships degrade unprecedentedly; we live on the surface of things, delving deeper less and less often;
