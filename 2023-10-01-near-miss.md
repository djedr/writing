# near miss

being tired after a long journey. a sleepless night. crash. sleep in. go to sleep normally the next night. wake up in the middle. unable to fall back asleep. walk. walk. ride. ride. drive. drive. back home. eat badly. be a million different people from one day to the next. can't change the mould, no, no, no, no, no. mold. colour. color. centre. center. the times, they are a-changin'.
