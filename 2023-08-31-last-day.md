# last day

the last day of the initial part of your life is kinda the opposite of the first day of the rest of your life.

instead of "kinda the opposite" I could've written "the antithesis" and the tone of the whole sentence would be different.

interesting how choice of words changes the tone and the reader's perception of a piece of writing. sometimes we're lazy and we read the tone to infer something about the message. it's good to be aware that we do it.
