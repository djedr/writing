# tyrosine

you need dopamine to function properly. to make dopamine you need a precursor, like tyrosine. to get enough tyrosine, you need to eat food that contains it, such as tuna or pumpkin seeds. so do that if you can. eat nutritious food, so that your body can make the stuff it needs to function. then function! don't you waste this good stuff on bullshit! use it to find your road and then go down it, all the way! all the way, god dammit!

# drifting off (4-5-4)

early evening  
hypnotizing sounds  
sleepy visions
