# news

news is very bad for mental health. it tends to spread weird politically-charged memes that can cause mental sickness on their own. not to elaborate on exacerbating a preexisting problem.

news tells us that we live in a world full of madness. the world of news is super-high intensity, everything turned up to 11, all the time. more at 11.

news distracts us from what is happening right here and right now by showing us madness happening there and then and often telling us what to think about that. information is selected, stories are created. an image of the world is pushed into minds with the hope of convincing them of its reality.

news at once comforts our anxiety and feeds it. now you know what's happening and how things are. but what's gonna happen next? tune in tomorrow.
