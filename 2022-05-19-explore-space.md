# A Dream About A World Without War, All Problems Solved, Harmonized Humanity Exploring Space Alongside Benevolent Aliens

All wars were halted at once.

People began to give up their weapons, laying them on huge heaps in central squares of cities, for destruction or dismantlement, to transform them from destructive into constructive things.

Over time conflict zones have shrunk to zero. Reconstruction started. Communities returned to their senses.

The politics of neo-constructivism were created and began to spread across the globe. Total nuclear disarmament was finally achieved.

Any work on or with destructive technologies was now carried out with global transparency. Even clandestine arms programs were over.

Finally the golden mean, the sweet spot of balancing between regulation and the lack of it, was found. A key component of it was the shifting of people's minds and opinions, mediated by a new scientific-humanist paradigm created by groundbreaking insights gained by an international group of altruistic intellectual giants who heavily employed altered states of consciousness achieved by all means available, including psychedelic substances.

Poverty and effective disease management was tackled. Death turned out to be a key element, ensuring long-term health not only of humanity but of all living organisms, the process of life itself. Vain attempts to fight natural death were thus abandoned in favor of reframing the matter: individual death was now cause for celebration of a completed life.

The natural environment was totally integrated with people. Coexistence turned out to be not only possible but necessary. The problem of climate change was solved as a side effect of these efforts.

After 256 years of global progress in these directions, the Fermi paradox was finally resolved. Advanced alien civilizations have turned out to be fairly common, but they would remain hidden from the developing ones until self-initiation through a breakthrough like the one described above. The key element of such a breakthrough would be the elimination of war and self-aggression.

As a consequence of unobstructed and sustainable exponential technological development, humanity's common landscape and horizons completely changed. New frontiers opened. The new focus was exploration of space, both external and internal, together, forever, in peace (cf Hicks 1992).

The downstairs neighbour's dog started barking again, the little motherfucker.

I opened my eyes, looked at the watch above me, bending like a snake (why do I still keep it up there?!).

It was all a dream. The reality remains unchanged and pretty shitty from this here point of viewing it.

On the other hand, perhaps it's not that bad. The sun is shining. A tram can be heard arriving. Blood flows through the veins of the city. Everyhing still standing. Maybe it is going somewhere. Maybe this dream is to be realized.

Or maybe it's all ridiculous and not worth a rat's ass. Who knows.

For now though there is a bunch of cells that insist on maintaining this organism which then produces thoughts and writes some of them down.

Cheers to that!

For the glory of the fatherland!

Or rather: for the glory of the integrated global organism which traverses the cosmos, inward and outward.
