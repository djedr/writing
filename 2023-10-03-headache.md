or other ailments of the body. the flow of neurotransmitters. its influence on one's thinking and feeling. behavior. microbes. pharmaceuticals. the weather. cultural context. air pollution. water pollution. environmental pollution. mental pollution. 

interruption.

all the trains of thought in books and articles that never arrived because of interruptions. misheard or misinterpreted sage advice. figuring out the mystery of life and then forgetting the answer. forgetting the question.

overthinking.

incorrect models. incorrect assumptions, axioms, premises. elaborate systems of thought built on them. years of mental effort in vain. thousands of years of tradition and culture going down the drain. a future perspective on today's religions and ideologies analogous to today's perspective on ancient religions and ideologies.

frustration.

suffering, toiling, futility. always a perspective from which anything one does is wrong. no leg to stand on. freefall. the void, the abyss. vast empty space. darkness. the unknown, the alien. words striking notes like hammers on strings.
