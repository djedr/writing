# pumpkin

unshelled pumpkin seeds treated in the oven lose all elasticity and become brittle, making shelling difficult and frustrating. it's almost as if the energy expended to get to the seed is greater than the energy obtained from eating the seed. eating seeds as a pastime activity, the toxicity of our city, of our city.

however pumpkin seeds have many excellent nutrients, the value of which is difficult to measure in shelling-frustration units. better to shell pumpkin seeds than a city. what a crazy world we live in where these are the kinds of things that are happening daily and nightly. it's a crazy, crazy world we live in; a crazy world we live in. whoooaaa!!!

perhaps there is a special technique of shelling these baked seeds that I haven't yet discovered that will yield optimal results, i.e. a minimal energy expenditure, for the most reliable extraction of these tasty nutritious seeds. yes, as it stands the extraction is not reliable at all. the shells crack together with the seeds. tiny pieces break off. a tiny piece of a seed trapped in a tiny piece of a shell is even harder and more pointless to try to extract. so here we are. somewhere you gotta cut your losses. black hole sun, won't you come and wash away the rain? black hole sun, won't you come, won't you come?

a park in the dark  
some rustling in the bushes  
could be a hedgehog
