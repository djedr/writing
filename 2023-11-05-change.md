# change

everything is always changing, to put it simplistically. "simplistically" is not a simple word. it's complex. it can be broken down into at least the following somewhat meaningful parts: simpl-ist-ical-ly. which can be broken down further into yet smaller parts.

anyway, as time and other resources fluctuate, so does everything that depends on them. it's interesting that time can be considered both a resource and a measuring device. having 5 minutes is similar to having 5 kilograms. but of what? you can't just have 5 kilograms. it must be of something. maybe a better analogy is space. I have 5 meters of space. or 5 square meters. or cubic. I can use them as I please. it's at a specific slice of space in general. now, I have 5 minutes of time. I can use it as I please. it is at a specific slice of time in general. "space in general", "time in general". what is that? they go together as spacetime. they are supposedly continuous. we only have one spacetime. could we have more than one isolated spacetimes? what would that mean.

anyway, so much for that thought. today's writing exercise is now concluded.
