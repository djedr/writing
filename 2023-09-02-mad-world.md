# mad world

today's prompt for this language model is: mad world.

as many songs tell us the world that we live in is mad and crazy. it's crazy-mad. possibly completely bonkers it is.

so many humans with such powerful minds and contradictory wants and interests and stories and religions and traditions and systems of law, governance, lifestyles, lineages, different temperaments... the chaos of "human nature". how can the world not be mad and crazy? so long as we collectively are crazy-mad, the world shall be too. that's what the world is for us. it's us, it's our perception of it, it's the effect of our actions. we shape it. we select what gels with us, discard, filter out what doesn't.

perhaps it's a random chaotic process, perhaps there is some metaintelligence that we serve without recognizing it thus far. perhaps the two are the same thing.

in any case, it's a truly mad mad crazy crazy world.
