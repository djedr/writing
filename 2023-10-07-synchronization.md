# synchronization

thousands of people in the same place gathered with a singular purpose at the same time. they have so much in common: each other in each other's vicinity. being human. the same purpose. conditions conducive to forming connections. natural system of synchronization at work. nodes in a network, relating.

certain letters in each other's vicinity form words. words cluster into still more complex packages. most probable meanings come to the forefront. puns and wordplay are had when there are multiple meanings with similar probabilities decodable from the same source.

and then suddenly change of pace, like a shifting of gears, like a-- an interruption-- it was going smooth-- now it's going-- stop and go-- stop and go-- stop and go-- a heartbeat. stablizing. calming down. breathe. slower. slower. slowly. the word "slow" is indeed slooow. the word "fast" is indeed fst!

guilty as charged of writing drivel, useless infuriating drivel, without any regard for any delicate sensibility. unprecedented neobrutal roughness. never start a story at the boring beginning. start it rather at the mildly interesting middle or the extremely exciting end.

you will never be able or even inclined to calculate the relationships between the parts of the whole that ends here.
