# nothing

What to write about? Easiest to start with nothing. From there, anything may follow. Or start with a falsehood. Supposedly anything follows from that.

So for example, let's say 2 + 2 = 5. This one is very easy to reach for. Why though? Why 2 + 2 = 4 seems to be more popular than e.g. 1 + 1 = 2. Is that a me thing? How could I tell? How can I tell my own biases from the actual state of things? What is the right amount of self-doubt? Where should questioning stop?

Right about here in this case. Why? Because. I decided. But did I really? Or did it happen on its own? What are the right words, the right model to describe what is actually happening as physical processes inside my body direct the movements of fingers to strike keys in the right order to produce letters, words, convey thoughts?

Very self-referential, I got very self-referential here. I mean the I of me. The writer's own strange loop. By the way, what's with some speakers referring to themselves as speakers, in the third person. As in "the speaker said...". The speaker speaks of the speaker where the subject and the object are one and the same.

How old a linguistic invention is "I"? Why is it denoted by the capital "I" in English? I never looked that up. Nor am I doing that now. The desire to do that is overriden by the desire not to break up the flow. Who has decided and how about which of these desires should be more important just now?

Simultaneously observing your actions and acting, what a trip! Who does the "your" in the previous sentence refer to? Who are you? From the writer's point of view an imagined reader. An abstract prototype of an entity. To be instantiated by potentially many different concrete readers. From the perspective of a reader it's their "I". Their? His? Her? Here we find ourselves at a meeting point of the English grammar, tradition, contemporary politics. 

Simple words of reference can carry so much weight. Or do they? Or are we projecting new meaning onto old patterns? We? Am I? I'm not sure if I agree. With what? With my perception of how unspecified people are interpreting language. Again, what a trip!
