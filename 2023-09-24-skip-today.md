little do we know of beginnings and ends.

record of feelings with hearthy broken english.

something very paradoxically compelling about the rawness of it.

the way different languages divvy up the spaces of sounds, symbols, meanings.

like color spaces; color blindness, sound blindness, symbol blindness, meaning blindness.

an inability to experience the full range of human experience -- good or bad? not possible to answer.

lying down slabs of concrete-- no, not concrete; go back; make it be huge cuboid(?) bricks, stacked into pyramids;

at once these are words and little building blocks of a sort of a visual composition, an illustration with spatial regularity;

how a single piece of creative output can work on multiple levels like that; the ones that have these independent layers are the most interesting;

now read into this what you want, but it's hard to disagree that a pierced retina, bloodshot, red, and painful, tiny, long, foreign body stuck in it, is nothing pleasant;

the smooth buttery manner in which the entire world seems to be unraveling stands in stark contrast with what naive visions of abrupt and violent end of civilization; constant surprise

a nice amalgamation of factors, that's the most likely semi-explanation of any complex phenomenon of the kind of the bronze age collapse or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; illness is not just an individual matter

it's groups, clumps of individuals that need to be medicated out of their miserable mutually-assured devolution into irreversible disrepair; no, no "medicated out of"; that's failed; what's needed is deep healing, a fundamental transformation

in conclusion, there can be no mistaking that walking backwards turn back time does not; the only sure time is right now, the only sure place is right here; that's where and when it all comes into focus, that's where and when the magic happens, hocus-pocus! and with that, I'm off to buy a new hat!
