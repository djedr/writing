# mind with a life of its own

people often talk about their mind as if it was separate from themselves. not only that, but models of the mind have been invented that break it down even further, into semi-independent parts. ego, superego, id. adult, child, parent. reptile, primate. higher, lower. conscious, subconscious. good angel, bad angel (or angel and devil)... seems like the mind can be subdivided into many semi-independent semi-overlapping entities, each with their distinctive personality or something like that. and these entities don't always (or perhaps usually don't) agree with each other. is one of them in control? if yes then is that control maintained at all times?

it's all pretty wild when you think about it. whoever "you" are.

caught myself again  
wasn't paying attention  
now I am aware
