# eternal return

...golden leaves rain down  
colder and darker each day  
the season of wind,

then

frozen lakes and ponds  
the coldest and darkest days  
the season of snow,

then

yellow flowers bloom  
warmer and brighter each day  
the season of birds,

then

lightnings and thunders  
the warmest and brightest days  
the season of sun,

then again...
