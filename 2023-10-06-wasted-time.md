# wasted time

is never coming back, so don't waste any more fretting over it.

also: endless cycles of worry while doing nothing to address whatever you're worrying about.

unfortunately these things happen. it is a real pattern of behavior that one can fall into.

realizing its irrationality is not enough to change it. people are not rational actors. it's not that simple.

anxiety, procrastination, depression, laziness, despair. so much time gone forever. did it have to be paid?

it doesn't matter. what's spent is spent. it's no longer available. what certainly is available is the now. in it we find ourselves when we are spending time right. a pithy little formulation comes to mind: 

> being in the now,
> time is found;
> being not in the now,
> time is lost;
