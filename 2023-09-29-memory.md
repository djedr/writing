# memory

I remember having this interesting thought that followed up on yesterday's thought. I imagined I'd write it here. but that was about an hour ago. in the meantime I occupied my mind with other things and now I don't remember the thought. just remember that I had it. but trying to recollect it fails.

now: how much effort is sensible to expend trying to recollect such thoughts. I tend to put quite a bit of effort relatively frequently into trying to remember various trivia and inconsequential things. why? I don't remember. probably a habit started a long time ago. maybe it's just how my mind works, an innate trait. how do you distinguish between "innate traits" and longstanding habits?

where do you put a stop to introspection? where do you stop thinking in general? what criteria to use to evaluate if various trains of thought are worth pursuing? how much of this is automated, a kind of unconscious self-regulation, how much is up to you? assuming there is will involved. does not believing in free will make one feel better?

a paradox: if there is no free will then I have no choice but to believe in free will and be frustrated trying in vain to apply it. either reality is inherently paradoxical or our models and thinking about it are. how could we tell the difference? this point feels like hitting a solid impenetrable wall or the edge of the universe.

still haven't recalled the thought. maybe it will come to me when I've long forgotten about trying.
