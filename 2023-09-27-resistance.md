# resistance

resistance is real. where you feel like you have to expend effort to make your way through walls put up by yourself. or by your own mind, if you like to see it as a separate thing. or by a part of your mind, if you prefer that. anyway, it's there. the feeling is there. the frustration is there. resistance is real.

so one part of you is going one way, another part is resisting, going the opposite way. and you tire yourself out, achieving nothing. at times you may have enough force to push through. then you achieve something. that is only sustainable though if you can consistently generate or otherwise obtain enough force.

another way is to rest or turn back. don't waste energy trying to make it through walls. instead look where there is least resistance. take the path of least resistance. or better yet: no resistance. or better yet: assistance, the opposite of resistance. go "with the grain". minimize wasted energy. surely though, we need effort to maintain life?

which, ultimately, seems to be the major thing that we do: maintaining life. perpetuating this odd process which produced us and of which we are a part. our frustrations are a part of it. wanting to go some way, but experiencing resistance -- that's part of life. figuring out how to overcome that.
