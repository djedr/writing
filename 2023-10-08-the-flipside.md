# the flipside

with enough practice, finding the flipside becomes a habit. a basic operation, almost like mathematical translation or rotation.

this is nice, but such habits can be dangerous. for example, the habit of always coming up with counter arguments makes you question your every move, rendering you paralyzed.

what makes a good scientist, may make for a lousy artist. what makes a good cop or a good soldier may make for a bad familyman. being good at something may make you really bad at something else. certain traits, habits, and skills that are adaptive in environment A are maladaptive in environment B.

can one be infinitely flexible and balanced? able to switch between personalities according to contexts? can you change suddenly? can you always rise to the occasion?

what you don't practice you forget. bad habits form insidiously, without you noticing. good habits take effort. is that always true? no. but it's an alarming prospect.

sand at the bottom of a river. dunes in a desert. a personality.
