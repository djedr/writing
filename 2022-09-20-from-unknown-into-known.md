# from unknown into known

the unknown is relative. to the knower. what is unknown to one knower may be known to another.

the unknown is temporary. once the unknown is interacted with by the knower, it moves into the known. eventually to become the known.

the movement of an item from the unknown into the known does not change the item. what changes is the knower, the knower's set of known items.

now: what happens when ideas and concepts manifest physically? how does this relate to the flow of the unknown into the known? is this even the same kind of phenomenon?

as thoughts are written down, they are pinpointed, manifested, separated from the thinker. now they can be interacted with, scrutinized, criticized. a thinker externalizes thoughts in this way to advance self-knowledge.
