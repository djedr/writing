# trust in change

as in "this too shall pass". pretty reliable.

a sleep-deprived mind loses all kinds of capabilities. sit and observe, that remains, so long it's awake.

having no will or strength in the present, in the ego, in the self, there is no choice but to trust in the natural, automatic processes. observe their unfolding. hope indeed dies last.
