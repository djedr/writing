# Make War Obsolete Or Else...

If the phenomenon of war is never made obsolete one of two scenarios are theoretically possible:

1. It goes on forever. We oscillate between war and no war. Just like we've been doing so far in history.
2. Humanity destroys itself in a final war. From a religious perspective this might be interpreted as the apocalypse. Every religion that features the concept seems to evolve a strand which pushes towards it as a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least to some extent. Adding to that human forces outside of religion, there is plenty of potential to realize this scenario.

In reality though scenario 1. is not stable, as it might (accidentally or not) turn into scenario 2., especially given continued development of destructive capacities: more powerful weapons, new and more efficient means of destruction. Adding to that nonhuman destructive forces, i.e. large-scale disasters and accidents which may trigger wars, the outlook seems rather bleak. Especially that we invest enormous amounts of time and effort into sharpening our swords, instead of focusing on mitigating our vulnerability to these disasters and accidents.

So continuing to use war as a tool to achieve political goals decreases our collective chances of survival in the long run. If then our goal is continued survival and development, war must be dropped, evolved out of, relegated into history, as an intermediate phenomenon. Whether or not past wars were justifiable or even necessary, as some would say, is irrelevant and beside the point. Counterfactual history might posit that an unnecessary war could lead to necessary wars, leading to the question of whether the first war, if it is possible to identify, was necessary or not. Perhaps it was a fork in the road which lead us to the mess we are in now. It doesn't matter. What is clear is that continuing this mess leads to a dead end. Refusing to change this critical aspect and expecting a bright future is madness.

We need to make a firm collective decision. Either we destroy ourselves or we make war obsolete. The wobbling in the middle that we practice will likely lead us to accidental destruction. Which perhaps will be an appropriate punishment for our stupidity. On the other hand accidentally growing out of war is very implausible.

The only constructive way forward then is to end war for good and never bring it back. To consciously get past this great filter of self-destruction. All other paths make our all current efforts and the efforts of our ancestors and descendants futile. Meaning there is no future for us and all of history has meant nothing. Is that where we stand?
