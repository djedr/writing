# A break

I've been commiting to GitHub every day continuously for about 16 weeks now.

Now I'm taking a break from that.

What have I learned?

That the Seinfeld method definitely works. It works to keep the thing going. The longer the chain, the more you want to keep it up. So it makes you more likely to show up every day. That's good.

But. What happens when you show up is still dependent on how difficult things are in general for you. If you are struggling, a simple rule like this won't magically fix things.

<!-- It's good for robots, which I definitely am not. -->

Anyway, I'm out of juice. So that's it for today.

<!-- I will go and try to put some things in order, gather ideas, and hopefully come back sooner rather than later. -->
