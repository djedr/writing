# improvise

to climb up you must first be down, to come down you must first be up. good times, bad times, you know I've had my share. clever arrangements of words stand above dull arrangements of words. no glucose: no wordbuilding. no worldbuilding. good intentions don't need to lead to good outcomes. bad to bad. billions of years of evolution taught plants many tricks. what's amazing is the _capacity_ to evolve.

I write some disjointed sentences: you make sense of them. thanks for your input. the more ambiguous, the more poetic. noetic. noogenic. noospheric. biospheric. atmospheric. pressure. people on streets.
