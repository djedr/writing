# look inside yourself

blackness, void. then, sensory data. touch. smell. this is itchy, this hurts. warm here, cool there. getting numb a-here. 

automatic movements. stroking hair. scratching. blinking. breathing. adjusting. moving the eyes around. typing, muscle memory. coordinating it all, pressing the keys in the right order. concurrently identifying the sounds outside.

electrical signals, chemical signals. signals. information. generating language, words. editing, criticizing. self-correction. stopping, pausing. thinking. blackness, void, emptiness. force of habit. patterns of behavior, established. more pain, numbness, adjusting. repetition.

read it all from the beginning, reconstruct the structure in your mind. more automated behaviors. motor tics. google this, check that. think about brand names becoming widely used verbs. how changing "twitter" to "x" is a very bad move in your opinion. scratchy-scratch. think how it's a miracle that we manage to communicate at all. how the end results of our mind-simulations, plans are something still different, something different than we originally imagined, how there's feedback from reality. other minds constituting reality. your mind constitut-- also your mind. reality, world is the overmind. or maybe there should be many levels, refine this formulation.

"throwing out ideas". how listening or reading or watching things, content about this and that and the other, how it has a hypnotic quality. realize multiple threads of thought in parallel forming, competing, trains of thought colliding. now you have to pick or serialize. how memory, innate hardware capacities affect the quality of the writing. interaction with the reader, simulating the reader. their capacities. switching roles. when you're writing, also be the reader. when you're reading, also become the writer. a writer is more likely to assume both of these perspectives. writing seems to be a more arcane art than reading.

the horrors of war. one group trying to dominate another. considering itself superior. trying to assure that superiority. failing. groups taking turns doing that. human nature. how much are we able to change, really?

laws of physics. losing the train of thought. letting go of it. how habit and anxiety help develop and maintain good memory. feedback loops. double-edged swords. sayings, aphorisms. jumping around the fractal of associations. visualizing.

a moment in time captured. rough outlines, dots on paper. the end, the end.
