# beside the point

really nothing coherent is able to be formed today so perhaps this sort of free writing will start things out; I wish programming could be like this, anyway, free writing itself is not so easy to start; nothing is easy to start, starting is just not easy; once you start: don't stop, try not to stop, because it can be really hard; you may not be able to imagine how hard it will be;

if you feel inspired -- do it now, do the thing you're inspired to do; it's fleeting; it comes and then it's gone; so if you can hold onto it and use it and let it out, because this might be its only chance; and if you don't? well then it won't be done, maybe never; that's likely not the end of the world; the end of the world isn't really something to worry about; maybe the end of humanity or humans, specific humans, the human who worries; maybe that's something to worry about, if survival is a priority; at some point it becomes paradoxical; munchhausen trilemma strikes at some point; metamunchhausen trilemma: at some point you arrive at the munchhausen trilemma; lemma, dilemma, trilemma, tetralemma, pentalemma, hexalemma, heptalemma, octalemma, nonalemma, decalemma; false trichotomy, false decatomy; 

always a framework to explain things in; some hidden assumptions; once assumptions change, we get a paradigm shift; iterative, additive, slow accretion and refinement without changing basic assumptions -- the daily bread and butter of science; every once in a while a Miyake event, a questioning and changing of the basic assumptions, a change of the framework; what causes that? how does it happen? is it cyclical? does it follow a pattern? don't know.

thoughts from the day, night, last few days, week, weeks, month, months, year, years, decade, decades, lifetime; they slowly flow out once the cork is extracted; a fibonacci spiral of thoughts, spirals out and keeps going, spirals out and keeps going, black and white at first, then red and yellow too; envelopes and branded plates, spinning, spinning, spinning: like this;

and then finally to cap it off, in closing, in summary, in summation (in what?!), summa summarum, don't start a larum, I must say that it's worth noting that you have to know about the fact of the matter which is the reality of the situation having to do with certain important aspects of the question being examined in terms of the present issue, namely: really nothing coherent is able to be formed today so perhaps this sort of free writing will cap things off.
