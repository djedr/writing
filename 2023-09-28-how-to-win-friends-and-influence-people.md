# how to win friends and influence people

I'm the wrong person to ask. however according to Dale Carnegie there are several principles and techniques, such as:

* praise generously
* criticizing before praising is like pulling teeth without anaesthetics
* look at things from other people's perspective
* if you're going to talk about others' mistakes, talk about your own mistakes first
* use "and" instead of "but"
* in a nutshell, apply the golden rule, i.e. "do unto others as you would have them do unto you"
* in other words be guided by reciprocity
* give others a reputation to live up to
* what people crave is the feeling of importance; give it to them
* appeal to people's nobler motives
* throw down a challenge

these are only a few random rules I could remember from the book off the top of my head. overall it mostly seems sensible -- it tries to instill in the reader the habit of seeing things from others' perspective. to be more empathetic. that said, some of the techniques, etc. do seem to verge on or cross into manipulation.

anyway, what's interesting to me is how the book inadvertently captures its time. it was published in 1936, almost 87 years ago. it's remarkable how certain words and expressions in the English language used then already sound archaic from today's perspective. also, how close the 1800s were to then, how different the world looked. to contrast the world 100 years before that book (that world was still relatively fresh in the collective memory then, and it's palpable throughout) and the world 100 years after it (today's world)... what a trip form then to now! 

time capsules are continuously created in writing. even this piece is one. perhaps you accidentally found it in what to me is the distant future. chances of that are slim, but not quite zero. so just in case I'll say: hi, thank you for stopping by.
