with age you figure out your default ways of dealing with things. when shit goes down, you tend to do x. x has these advantages and these disadvantages. now how do you leverage that? do you even? for what purpose?

that's the thing. the purpose. it's not even constant. it should be continuously reevaluated and reaffirmed, probably. I guess making it pseudo-constant works too, as long as you continuously reaffirm it. to make it pseudo-constant you just reinterpret it in light of changing circumstances, without changing the original encoding. swap out the meaning.

how fast can we update our internal software? is there a way out of this mess?
