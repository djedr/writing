# rush

sometimes just fitting things into a 5 or 2 minutes you have inbetween activities can have surprising consequences. sometimes it doesn't.

but when it does and the consequences are positive, it's been worth it. so should you do it? yes, do it! do things while things are possible! seize the day!
