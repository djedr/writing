# simulations

one of popular modern semi-religious memes is the simulation hypothesis. that we somehow exist in a reality simulated by some kind of a computer.

assuming certain versions of this hypothesis can lead to pretty crazy conclusions and behaviors.

in the end it seems like old philosophical concepts, just described using modern vocabulary. similar ideas existed before computers, but obviously couldn't be described in terms of them. the media that we use to communicate really do determine how we think to a large extent.

anyway we generate these hypotheses to try and guess how the reality that we find ourselves in really works. presumably to get some advantage, some lever which we can use to manipulate it, break out of it, or whatever. it's plausible to me that we will never achieve that, but that may be just another hypothesis. ;)

it's more like every mind is a kind of computer that simulates reality. perhaps reality itsef, the physical universe can also be viewed as a computer. at this point, occam's razor would suggest that it is the ultimate one. anyway, let's not get into that here.

now the individual simulations then represent at least crude replicas of at least parts of the whole thing. different replicas may contain different parts and different details. every replica, as well as the original, is dynamic: it changes over time. how it all changes depends on individual simulations. every mind seems to have a small degree of what we perceive as autonomy or free will. of course we don't even agree on whether that exists. but as a concept it does. if we assume it does, it's pretty plain to me that it's very limited. and variable.

so every simulation has the capacity to influence every other simulation, including the ultimate simulation (= reality). current reality is the result of all these interactions. reality is fractal (self-similar) in that it contains semi-copies of itself. it is also self-referential and dynamic. change is the only constant. panta chorei. nothing lasts. nothing is perfect. nothing is lost. nothing is permanent. nothing is complete.

it may be that there is no "ultimate" anything. circularity and contradiction may be not only unavoidable but fundamental. we clearly haven't found clear answers to these existential questions and it's possible that we never will. some answers may feel like that for a while, but as soon as questioning is applied to them, we are back to the natural state of not knowing.

and with that, toodeloo!
