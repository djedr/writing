# Artificial Intelligence

I used to believe in the imminence of the technological singularity. I don't anymore.

Once I got into the basics of artificial intelligence. At some point I lost interest. My skepticism grew.

There is a suspension of disbelief required to buy into these things. It's as if some of the visceral reality that is before us has to be ignored to believe that these technological breakthroughs will appear and carry us out of our misery.

It may be more likely that a failed version of them will instead carry us into greater misery instead. Or, to be less dramatic, that all of this is just an inconsequential distraction.

Or maybe this is just a dark and dismissive view of things. Maybe even the entertainment industry, movies, games, books of fiction -- all these things are not merely distractions. Maybe I overlook their depth, so that I can triage reality in a way that doesn't overwhelm my rational faculties.

In order to progress creatively there has to be an underlying belief in the magical layer of meaning that lies beneath the surface of every thing. And everything.

If there is no such layer then why bother writing a collection of paragraphs like the one that I appear to be generating now? What motivates and pushes me to do that?

What am I reacting to, if I can be reduced to a collection of particles, a chemical process, governed only by physical laws? Is there a significant component of self-directedness to this thing?

Here I was interrupted, so I lost my train of thought. That's another peculiarity of being a thinking organism.
