pop pop pop
goes the corn
removing all the pretense

an earthquake swallows people whole
invalidating all plans

one's luck is another's misfortune
some one else still remains unaware
or indifferent

hot metal burns precious skin
one second of contact
hours of pain
weeks of recovery

a cosmic explosion swallows a planet whole
removing all the pretense
invalidating all plans
