# cul-de-sac

blind alleys are natural. they're everywhere. 

hitting a blind alley might mean either that you've arrived at your destination or that you got lost. if you have arrived, you should know it.

moving on, the degree to which others' decisions turn out to irreversibly shape your life is astonishing. life is astonishing.

moving on, the power of music to shape one's mood is incredible. it's as if you really can sync up to the vibe.

moving on, we didn't realize just how magical our childhoods without computers and the internet were. we always seem to appreciate by contrast.

moving on, it can be so frustrating when a long many-step process ends in a failure at the very last step. life has many little frustrations like that.

moving on, some techniques are available and have been worked out to help manage one's emotions. but you can't avoid emotions.

moving on, arbitrary deadlines and imaginary pressure of time do have real consequences. sometimes bad, sometimes good. they are an imperfect tool.

moving on, irrationality and behavior driven purely by immediate emotions happens not only on individual level, but on any level of human organization, including countries and ultimately the globe. we are an emotional bunch.

in conclusion: blind alleys are natural. they're everywhere.
