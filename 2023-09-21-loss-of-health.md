# loss of health

we appreciate by contrast. a healthy body or mind is appreciated by contrast with an unhealthy body or mind.

when a basic faculty that was taken for granted goes away, we notice how flawlessly it's been working.

comparison may be a thief of joy, but it also may be a provider of appreciation. depending on the sign of the contrast.

even feeling dizzy and sleepy after a long day with too little sleep may help appreciate the moments of sharp focus. don't squander these moments.

yes, there may be better ways to utilize those faculties. don't let them spoil without ever manifesting their extent.
