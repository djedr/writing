# promised land

inevitably disappoints. the only sure thing is frustration.

the only thing you're surely gonna get here is frustration.

you will be frustrated. your expectations will be frustrated.

only two things are sure in life: death and frustration.

are you frustrated yet? no? wait a while. I promise you will be.

accept your fate. your fate is to be frustrated.

I guarantee you will be frustrated. just wait a while.

this is the land of frustration. it's abundant around here.

I can promise you one thing: frustration. you shall find it.

you can count on it. you can rely on it. you can feel at home in it.

frustration.
